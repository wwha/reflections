When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1) Share with others
2) Keep it backup to the cloud.
Make new changes to sync the local file.

Why might you want pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
It may ruin the local changes when this occurs unexpectedly during a local change.
